# MATEMATICA

Welcome to the **MATEMATICA** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students, educators, and enthusiasts of mathematics. Here, you will find a wide range of materials including lecture notes, problem sets, research articles, and solved exercises across various fields of mathematics. Additionally, this repository includes programming notes, code snippets, and exercises for Python, C++, and MATLAB.

## Repository Contents

### Mathematics Resources
- **Lecture Notes**: Detailed notes from courses I take during my math BSc, along with additional material used to prepare for exams.
- **Cheatsheets**: Short and concise documents containing the most essential information and properties of different math concepts, designed for quick reference.
- **Problem Sets and Exercises**: A collection of exercises and problems aimed at preparing for exams, improving proficiency in specific topics, and deepening your understanding of various mathematical concepts.
- **Research Articles**: Documents made by me on topics I find interesting, providing insights and developments in various areas of mathematics.

### Programming Resources
- **Python**: Notes, code snippets, and exercises for learning and mastering Python programming.
- **C++**: Comprehensive materials on C++ programming, including notes, examples, and exercises.
- **MATLAB**: Resources to help you understand and use MATLAB for mathematical computing.

### Be Aware !

This is a long-term project, so the structure is not definitive. The content may not always be in the same place as you found it the previous day, and there will be several moving parts. I am by no means in a position to teach someone these topics; these materials are primarily useful for me, and I have decided to share them for free. I will be using AI to translate documents from Italian to English to save excessive time, and eventually to generate code. For intellectual honesty, I will always indicate when the code has been generated with AI.
