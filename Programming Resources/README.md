# Programming Resources

This repository contains subdirectories for different programming languages, each containing relevant projects and programs. The current structure is divided into Python, C++, and MATLAB.

## Folder structure

- **Python**

- **MATLAB**


## Overview of the projects
### Python
- [**trigvalues**](https://github.com/donatomartinelli/MATEMATICA/blob/main/Programming%20Resources/Python/trigvalues.py)
  The `trigvalues` program is designed to help users practice and review trigonometric values for common angles. It randomly selects an angle and a trigonometric function, prompts the user to reveal the answer, and displays the corresponding value. Works in terminal.
- [**calc_one_quiz**](https://github.com/donatomartinelli/MATEMATICA/blob/main/Programming%20Resources/Python/calc_one_quiz.py)
  The `calc_one_quiz` program is a quiz tool that presents random questions based on key mathematical formulas for limits, derivatives, and integrals. It defines the formulas first, then randomly selects a question, giving you time to think and solve it. When you're ready with your answer, you can press Enter to check the correct solution. This helps reinforce learning by allowing you to actively recall and apply the formulas in a quiz-like format. Works in Jupyter Notebook.
